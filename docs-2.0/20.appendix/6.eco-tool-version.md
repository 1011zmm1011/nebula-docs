!!! compatibility

    The core release number naming rule is `X.Y.Z`, which means `Major version X`, `Medium version Y`, and `Minor version Z`. The upgrade requirements for the client are:

    - Upgrade the core from `X.Y.Z1` to `X.Y.Z2`: It means that the core is fully forward compatible and is usually used for bugfixes. It is recommended to upgrade the minor version of the core as soon as possible. At this time, the client can stay **not upgraded**.
    
    - Upgrade the core from `X.Y1.*` to `X.Y2.*`: It means that there is some incompatibility of API, syntax, and return value. It is usually used to add functions, improve performance, and optimize code. The client needs to be upgraded to `X.Y2.*`.
    
    - Upgrade the core from `X1.*.*` to `X2.*.*`: It means that there is a major incompatibility in storage formats, API, syntax, etc. You need to use tools to upgrade the core data. The client must be upgraded.

    - The default core and client do not support downgrade: You cannot downgrade from `X.Y.Z2` to `X.Y.Z1`.
 
    - The release cycle of a `Y` version is about 6 months, and its maintenance and support cycle is 6 months.
    
    - The version released at the beginning of the year is usually named `X.0.0`, and in the middle of the year, it is named `X.5.0`.
    
    - The file name contains `RC` to indicate an unofficial version (`Release Candidate`) that is only used for preview. Its maintenance period is only until the next RC or official version is released. Its client, data compatibility, etc. are not guaranteed.
    
    - The files with `nightly`, `SNAPSHOT`, or date are the nightly versions. There is no quality assurance and maintenance period.

!!! compatibility

    All ecosystem tools of 1.x did not support NebulaGraph 2.x core.

## NebulaGraph Studio

NebulaGraph Studio (Studio for short) is a graph database visualization tool that can be accessed through the Web. It can be used with NebulaGraph DBMS to provide one-stop services such as composition, data import, writing nGQL queries, and graph exploration. For details, see [What is NebulaGraph Studio](../nebula-studio/about-studio/st-ug-what-is-graph-studio.md).

!!! Note

    The release of the Studio is independent of NebulaGraph core, and its naming method is also not the same as the core naming rules. The compatible relationship between them is as follows.

|:---|:---|
| {{ nebula.release }}  | {{studio.base300}}(9e2a120)|

## Nebula Dashboard

Nebula Dashboard (Dashboard for short) is a visualization tool for monitoring the status of machines and services in the NebulaGraph cluster. For details, see [What is Nebula Dashboard](../nebula-dashboard/1.what-is-dashboard.md).

|:---|:---|
| {{ nebula.release }}  | {{dashboard.release}}(49ab1bc) |

## Nebula Explorer

Nebula Explorer (Explorer for short) is a graph exploration visualization tool that can be accessed through the Web. It is used with the NebulaGraph core to visualize interaction with graph data. Users can quickly become map experts, even without experience in map data manipulation. For details, see [What is Nebula Explorer](../nebula-explorer/about-explorer/ex-ug-what-is-explorer.md).

## Nebula Exchange

Nebula Exchange (Exchange for short) is an Apache Spark&trade application for batch migration of data in a cluster to NebulaGraph in a distributed environment. It can support the migration of batch data and streaming data in a variety of different formats. For details, see [What is Nebula Exchange](../nebula-exchange/about-exchange/ex-ug-what-is-exchange.md).

## Nebula Importer

Nebula Importer (Importer for short) is a CSV file import tool for NebulaGraph. The Importer can read the local CSV file, and then import the data into the NebulaGraph database. For details, see [What is Nebula Importer](../nebula-importer/use-importer.md).

## Nebula Spark Connector

Nebula Spark Connector is a Spark connector that provides the ability to read and write NebulaGraph data in the Spark standard format. Nebula Spark Connector consists of two parts, Reader and Writer. For details, see [What is Nebula Spark Connector](../nebula-spark-connector.md).

## Nebula Flink Connector

Nebula Flink Connector is a connector that helps Flink users quickly access NebulaGraph. It supports reading data from the NebulaGraph database or writing data read from other external data sources to the NebulaGraph database. For details, see [What is Nebula Flink Connector](../nebula-flink-connector.md).
