# Uninstall NebulaGraph

This topic describes how to uninstall NebulaGraph.

!!! caution

    Before re-installing NebulaGraph on a machine, follow this topic to completely uninstall the old NebulaGraph, in case the remaining data interferes with the new services.

## Prerequisites

You have stopped the NebulaGraph services. For more information, see [Manage NebulaGraph services](../2.quick-start/5.start-stop-service.md).

## Step 1: Delete data files of the Storage and Meta Services

If you have modified the `data_path` in the configuration files for the Meta Service and Storage Service, the directories where NebulaGraph stores data may not be in the installation path of NebulaGraph. Check the configuration files to confirm the data paths, and then manually delete the directories to clear all data.

For a NebulaGraph cluster, delete the data files of all Storage and Meta servers.

!!! caution

    Make sure that you have backed up all important data.

1. Find the data paths in the [Storage Service disk settings](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/4.storage-config.md#disk_configurations) and [Meta Service storage settings](../5.configurations-and-logs/1.configurations/2.meta-config.md#storage_configurations). For example:

   ```bash
   ########## Disk ##########
   # Root data path. Split by comma. e.g. --data_path=/disk1/path1/,/disk2/path2/
   # One path per Rocksdb instance.
   --data_path=/nebula/data/storage
   ```

2. Delete the directories found in step 1.

## Step 2: Delete the installation directories

The default installation path is `/usr/local/nebula`. It can be modified while installing NebulaGraph. Delete all installation directories, including the `cluster.id` files in them.

### Uninstall NebulaGraph deployed with source code

Find the installation path of NebulaGraph, and delete the directories.

### Uninstall NebulaGraph deployed with RPM packages

1. Run the following command to get the NebulaGraph version.

   ```bash
   $ rpm -qa | grep "nebula"
   ```

   The return message is as follows.

   ```bash
   nebula-graph-{{ nebula.release }}-1.x86_64
   ```

2. Run the following command to uninstall NebulaGraph.

   ```bash
   sudo rpm -e <nebula_version>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm -e nebula-graph-{{ nebula.release }}-1.x86_64
   ```

3. Delete the installation directories.

### Uninstall NebulaGraph deployed with DEB packages

1. Run the following command to get the NebulaGraph version.

   ```bash
   $ dpkg -l | grep "nebula"
   ```

   The return message is as follows.

   ```bash
   ii  nebula-graph  {{ nebula.release }}  amd64     Nebula Package built using CMake
   ```

2. Run the following command to uninstall NebulaGraph.

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -r <nebula_version>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -r nebula-graph
   ```

3. Delete the installation directories.

### Uninstall NebulaGraph deployed with Docker Compose

1. In the `nebula-docker-compose` directory, run the following command to stop the NebulaGraph services.

   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

2. Delete the `nebula-docker-compose` directory.
